# Problem 1

The data contained in `ny_noaa` provides information about the weather
in New York on various dates. There are a total of 7 variables (columns)
and 2,595,176 observations (rows). For each date, there are 5 metrics,
including precipitation, snow, snow depth, maximum temperature, and
minimum temperature. There is also an id variable. At a glance, there is
a lot of missing data, across many variables.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)

data("ny_noaa")

The dates are separated into 3 columns representing the year, month, and
date. The units are changed to more commonly used values. Precipitation
is converted to mm, instead of tenths of mm. Temperature is reported in
Celsius, instead of tenths of Celsius. Snow depth is reported in inches,
instead of mm. These were all done because of normal conventions.
Snowfall is reported in tenths of inches because often it is a small
amount of snow that falls per period of time.

``` r
ny_noaa =
  mutate(ny_noaa,
         year = year(date),
         month = month(date),
         day = day(date),
         prcp = as.numeric(prcp)/10, # convert to mm from tenths of mm
         tmax = as.numeric(tmax)/10, # convert to C from tenths of C
         tmin = as.numeric(tmin)/10, # convert to C from tenths of C
         snow = as.numeric(snow)/25.4*10, # convert to tenths of inches from mm
         snwd = as.numeric(snwd)/25.4 # convert to inches from mm
         )
```

The average snowfall is 1.96 tenths of an inch. This makes sense since
for much of the year, there is no snowfall, so it brings down the
average.

The plots below show the average max temperature in January and July,
across all stations, for each year. There is a lot of scatter, but
roughly in January the average max temperature increased and then
plateaued, whereas for July, it stayed about the same. That being said,
there are a lot of points that don’t follow this pattern. Due to this
large scatter, it’s difficult to say whether there are outliers, since
there isn’t a clear pattern.

``` r
library(patchwork)

january =
  ny_noaa |>
  drop_na(tmax) |>
  filter(month==1) |>
  group_by(year) |>
  summarize(mean_tmax = mean(tmax, na.rm=TRUE)) |>

    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(se=FALSE) +
    labs(
      title = "January Temperature",
      x = "Year",
      y = "Average Maximum Temperature (C)"
    )

july =

      y = "Average Maximum Temperature (C)"
    )

# Problem 2

The demographic dataset is loaded and tidied below.

``` r

  read_csv(file = "data/nhanes_covar.csv", skip=4) |>
  janitor::clean_names() |>
  mutate(
    sex = case_match(
      sex,
      1 ~ "male",
      2 ~ "female"
    ),
    education = case_match(
      education,
      1 ~ "less than high school",
      2 ~ "high school equivalent",
      3 ~ "more than high school"
    ),
    sex = as.factor(sex),
    education = as.factor(education),
    age = as.integer(age)
  )

The accelerometer data is loaded and tided below.

``` r
accel = 
  read_csv(file = "data/nhanes_accel.csv") |>
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    ## Rows: 250 Columns: 1441
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## dbl (1441): SEQN, min1, min2, min3, min4, min5, min6, min7, min8, min9, min1...
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

Next, the two datasets are combined and further tidying is done. This
now prepares the final dataset in `mims`.

``` r
mims =
  left_join(demo,accel,by="seqn") |>
  drop_na(sex:education) |>
  filter(age>=21) |>
  pivot_longer(
    min1:last_col(),
    names_to = "minute",
    names_prefix = "min",
    values_to = "mims"
  )

mims
```

The table below shows the number of men and women in each education
category. There are more males in high school equivalent, whereas about
the same male and female in the other educations. There are overall more
people in “more than high school” than “high school equivalent” than
“less than high school”.

``` r
demo |>
  drop_na() |>
  janitor::tabyl(education, sex)
```

    ##               education female male
    ##  high school equivalent     23   36
    ##   less than high school     28   27
    ##   more than high school     59   56

The grouped boxplot below shows the age distribution for male and female
at each education level. There is a lot of spread, but the median age is
lowest for those with “more than high school” education. Males have a
median age younger than females for all educations, except “more than
high school”.

``` r
demo |>
  select(education,sex,age) |>
  drop_na() |>
  ggplot(aes(x=education,y=age,fill=sex)) +
    geom_boxplot() +
    labs(
      title = "Age Distribution",
      x = "Education Level",
      y = "Age"
    )
```

The plots below show the sum of the MIMS for each individual, across
ages, between male and female, and for each education level. In general,
as you get older, the total MIMS decreases. For “less than high school”,
males typically have higher MIMS (except at young ages), whereas for the
other education levels, females typically have higher MIMS.

``` r
less =
  mims |>
  filter(education=="less than high school") |>
  aggregate(mims ~ seqn, sum) |>
  left_join(demo,by="seqn") |>
  ggplot(aes(x=age,y=mims)) +
    geom_point(aes(color=sex)) +
    geom_smooth(aes(color=sex),se=FALSE) +
    labs(title="Less than high school")

more =

The plots below show the MIMS value at each hour for both male and
female, for different education levels, but across all ages. In general,
females have higher MIMS throughout the day. Across all educations, MIMS
decreases than increases to a peak in the middle, then decreases again.
This could reflect the decreasing movement as people are falling asleep,
then the greater movement that peaks in the middle of the day, then the
decreasing movement towards the night.

``` r
less =
  mims |>
  filter(education=="less than high school") |>
  ggplot(aes(x=as.numeric(minute)/60,y=mims)) +
    geom_smooth(aes(color=sex),se=FALSE) +
    labs(
      title="Less than high school",
      x="hour")

more =
  mims |>
  filter(education=="more than high school") |>
  ggplot(aes(x=as.numeric(minute)/60,y=mims)) +
